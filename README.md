About meðŸ‘ˆ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm **Umit**! I'm the kind of person who doesn't give up until I've accomplished what I set out to do. I'm a hard-working nerd who loves to learn new things and push myself to be the best I can be. Whether it's coding in a new language or mastering a complex project, I'm always up for a challenge. I've been known to pull all-nighters to get the job done, but I also know how to have fun and relax. In my free time,...I don't have free timeðŸ¤”. If you're looking for someone who's passionate, dedicated, and always willing to go the extra mile, I'm your guy!


My first project :keyboard:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of my earliest projects was a full-stack web application that allowed users to order food online and pay for it securely using Stripe. I used React for the front-end and NodeJS with the Express framework for the back-end. Users could browse a menu, select items, and customize their orders. They could also create an account. I integrated Stripe's API to handle payments. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding project that helped me develop my skills in web development and payment processing.

Working on as a side questðŸ”­
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, I'm working on two projects at the same time(Told you, no free time). On one hand, I'm building an E-Commerce website as a personal challenge to improve my skills in React and NodeJS. It's been great to experiment with different design patterns and tools, and to learn more about the intricacies of online transactions. On the other hand, I'm also working on a project in C#. I find it fascinating to explore the nuances of a new language and to see how it can help solve different types of problems. Although, I have to admit, sometimes I feel like my brain is switching back and forth between two completely different worlds! But as they say, variety is the spice of life - or in my case, the spice of coding. And who knows, maybe one day I'll build an E-Commerce website in C# - just for the fun of it.
